          JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language
          which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an
          interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic
          interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in
            execution environments.
          </li>
          <li>
            JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming
            language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1 id="section1">Hello Word</h1>
        <p>
          A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that prints Hello, World! on the
          screen. Since it's a very simple program, this program is often used
          to introduce a new programming language to beginners.
        </p>
        <h3>function msg(){ alert("Hello JavaScript"); }</h3>
        <h1 id="section2">Variable</h1>
        <p>
          A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are
          two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global
          variable. There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable
          (also known as identifiers). Name must start with a letter (a to z or
          A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign. After first letter we
          can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1. JavaScript variables are
          case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.
        </p>
        <h1 id="section3">Decraring variable</h1>
        <p>
          A JavaScript local variable is declared inside block or function. It
          is accessible within the function or block only. For example:
        </p>
        <p>function abc(){ var x=10;//local variable }</p>
        <p>
          A JavaScript global variable is accessible from any function. A
          variable i.e. declared outside the function or declared with window
          object is known as global variable. For example:
        </p>
        <p>
          var data=200;//gloabal variable function a(){ document.writeln(data);
          } function b(){ document.writeln(data); } a();//calling JavaScript
          function b();
        </p>
        <h1 id="section4">Variable scope</h1>
        <p>
          Block scope: Earlier JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function
          Scope. let and const are the two new important keywords that were
          introduced by the ES6 and these two keywords provide Block Scope in
          JavaScript. ECMAScript (ES6) 2015 was the second major revision to
          JavaScript. Variables that are declared inside a { } block cannot be
          accessed from outside the block.
        </p>
        <h1 id="section5">Global variable</h1>
        <p>
          A JavaScript global variable is declared outside the function or
          declared with window object. It can be accessed from any function.
        </p>
        <h1 id="section6">Data type</h1>
        <p>
          JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of
          values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript. Primitive
          data type Non-primitive (reference) data type JavaScript is a dynamic
          type language, means you don't need to specify type of the variable
          because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine. You need to use
          var here to specify the data type. It can hold any type of values such
          as numbers, strings etc. For example:
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
