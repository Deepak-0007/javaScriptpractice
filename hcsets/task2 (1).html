    <h1>I create a page for my cat</h1>
    <p>
      The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong
      flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted
      to killing small prey like mice and rats. Its night vision and sense of
      smell are well developed
