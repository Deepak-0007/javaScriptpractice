    <p>
      <img src="th.jpg" alt="img" height="200" width="200" />The cat (Felis
      catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the
      only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred
      to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild
      members of the family.[4] Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can
      also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids
      human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and
      their ability to kill vermin. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by
      various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid
      species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and
      retractable claws adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. Its
      night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication
      includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling,
      and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. Although the cat is a
      social species, it is a solitary hunter. As a predator, it is crepuscular,
      i.e. most active at dawn and dusk. It can hear sounds too faint or too
      high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other
      small mammals.[7] It also secretes and perceives pheromones.[8]

      Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with
      litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.[9] Domestic cats are
      bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as
      cat fancy. Population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and
      neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has
      resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to th
